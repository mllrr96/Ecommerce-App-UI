# 🛒 E-Commerce Flutter App

An elegant and modern **E-Commerce App UI** built with Flutter, inspired by
the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/D08zlpsIjNHo0rliv9bIRJ/Ecommerce-App-UI-Kit-(Freebie)-(Community)?node-id=152-4804&p=f&t=2V7zwSFgWsQUp7QC-0)
by [Hamza Naeem](https://www.figma.com/@hamzauix). This project serves as a UI showcase and does not include backend functionality.
